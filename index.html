         <div style="text-align: center;"><p style="font-size: large;text-align: center;">The key to economic development and ending poverty is investment. Nations achieve prosperity by investing in four priority areas.<br> The most important is investing in people, through quality education and healthcare. The next is infrastructure, such as electricity,<br> safe water, digital networks, and public transport. The third is natural capital, protecting nature. The fourth is business investment. <br>The key is finance: mobilising the funds to invest at the scale and speed required.

            <p style="font-size: large;">In principle, the world should operate as an interconnected system. The rich countries, with high levels of education, healthcare,<br> infrastructure, and business capital, should supply ample finance to the poor countries. As the emerging market countries became<br> richer, profits and interest would flow back to the rich countries as returns on their investments.
